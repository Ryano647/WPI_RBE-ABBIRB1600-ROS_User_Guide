- [AVRS (Automatic Vehicle Recharging Station) - MQP](https://github.com/AVRS-MQP/AVRS 
)

The goal of this project is to automatically plug in autonomous electric vehicles, thus automating one of the last steps a level 5 autonomous vehicle would need for complete independence from human assistance. For the project we are using an ABB-IRB 1600 industrial robotic arm, a custom end effector capable of opening and closing the charging port as well as tool changing between 2 charging port standards, custom computer vision / point cloud processing software, as well as robotic arm kinematic software. This is accomplished using ROS-I.


- [Seurobot](https://github.com/RBE4815-Team6/Seurobot)

This project was an exercise for RBE/ME 4815 in using an industrial robotic arm to perform the complex task of drawing an image in the style of pointillism. Custom tooling was made to hold three dry erase markers to draw pre-processed images. Accomplishing this task required numerous frame transformations between the markers and precise motion to avoid damaging the tooling. The real-time logic needed to perform this task required the use of ROS to control the arm. Using ROS allowed us to write our control software in Python and easily process images. 

-  [Catching Balls with the ABB]

This project was also an exercice for RBE/ME 4815 using an industrial robotic arm to catch balls thrown towards the arm with a hoop. Two  Pixy cameras mounted above and to the side of the arm to locate the balls as they were in the air. This project was done on a student's laptop, unlike the previous two, and details the process of setting up ROS-I from scratch.
